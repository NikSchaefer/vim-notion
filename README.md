# VIM for Notion

This is a project created by [Luke Ingalls](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-ingalls/).

In general, I have implemented commands to the degree in which I miss them when using notion. This is by no means meant to be a complete implementation. If you have questions you can reach out to me.
